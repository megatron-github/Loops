# Loops
An introduction to writing loops in Python

File: alphabet.py

The alphabet game is a game played on long car trips, in which the occupants of the car try to find every letter of the alphabet on signs outside of the car. As an adaptation of this game, your task is to write a program that, given a string of text from the user, tells which letters in the alphabet do not appear in the string. Your program should consider both uppercase and lowercase letters to qualify as a letter in the string; in other words, both “A” and “a” as the letter A in the string. Your program should print, in alphabetical order, the uppercase version of the letters that do not appear in the input.

File: ball.py

A standard science experiment is to drop a ball and see how high it bounces. Once the “bounciness” of the ball has been determined, the ratio gives a bounciness index. For example, if a ball dropped from a height of 10 feet bounces 6 feet high, the index is 0.6 and the total distance traveled by the ball is 16 feet after one bounce. If the ball were to continue bouncing, the distance after two bounces would be: 10 ft + 6 ft + 6 ft + 3.6 ft = 25.6 ft — note that the ball traveled 16 feet on the first bounce, and 9.6 feet on the second bounce. Note that distance traveled for each successive bounce is the distance to the floor plus 0.6 of that distance
as the ball comes back up. Write a program that lets the user enter the initial height of the ball (10 in this example), its height after the first bounce (6 in this example), and the number of bounces. Output should be the total distance traveled by the ball, rounded to at most 2 decimal places.

File: microwave.py

Imagine you are using the timer on a microwave. You enter the time you want to count down from, in minutes and seconds, and the microwave counts down until it reaches 0:00. Your program will, given the minutes and seconds to count down, print the times remaining displayed by the microwave while the timer counts down, with one time on each line. Note: Your program shouldn’t actually take a second between printing each line
